        as scrambled, nonsensical Latin derived from Cicero's 1st-century BC text De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum.</h1>

        ipsum was born as a nonsense text. “It's not Latin, though it looks like it, and it actually says
        nothing,” Before & After magazine answered a curious reader, “Its words loosely approximate the frequency with
        which letters occur in English, which is why at a glance it looks pretty real.”<br><br>"As Cicero would put it, “Um,
        not so fast.”<br><br>
        The placeholder text, beginning with the line“Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit”, looks
        like Latin because in its youth, centuries ago, it was Latin.<br><br>
        Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar from Hampden-Sydney College, is credited with discovering the source behind the
        ubiquitous filler text. In seeing a sample of lorem ipsum, his interest was piqued by consectetur—a genuine, albeit
        rare, Latin word. Consulting a Latin dictionary led McClintock to a passage from De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (“On the
        Extremes of Good and Evil”), a first-century B.C. text from the Roman philosopher Cicero.
